# Overview

Netergy is a pet project of mine, not necessarily geared towards weight loss, but capturing the data that will inform such activities, and the results of such actions over time.

I do not intend to provide support for any usage of this project.

I do intend to make breaking changes, because, keeping people on their toes is something I need to do. Specifically, I need to keep on my toes, if I am to lose this mass...

As a result, if you build something on top of this, or the data models, and the land shifts under your feet without expectation, you no longer have to worry. You should now anticipate it, by way of the previous paragraph! ^_^


# Setup

If you are insane and want to use the project, or a portion therein, maybe it'll help. Maybe it won't. I can't motivate you.

However, to get started, you'll need to create a virtual Python environment, for example:

`python -m venv .dev`

If you choose a different virtual environment folder, make sure to [add an .gitignore entry](./.gitignore) to your local copy.

Then you'll need to activate it:

`source .dev/bin/activate`

I intend to, once this project starts finding its own feet on the ground, add at least a `test` virtual environment. But, for now... not now.

There are some unit tests though! ^_^
